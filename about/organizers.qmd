[Federica Gazzelloni](https://federicagazzelloni.com/) Lead Organizer - from Rome. I am an independent researcher passionate about data science, with a background in actuarial statistics and expertise in collaborative environments. My journey extends from traditional actuarial work to advanced data science with R. As the lead organizer of R-Ladies Rome and Rome R Users Group, I advocate for inclusivity and knowledge-sharing, hosting various events promoting the R language but not limited to. I am also a book club facilitator with the DSLC (former R4DS) online community, fostering collaborative learning. Additionally, I have contributed as a reviewer to global health initiatives, emphasizing accessible learning and effective communication. (May 2025 to Present)

[Lucy Michaels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucymichaels/) Organizer - from Rome. With 25 years in mathematics education and financial leadership, I’m completing a Master's in Analysis & Modelling of Data & Processes as well as IBM’s Data Science Certificate, ready to pivot into Data Science.  This has led me to work on hands-on projects using R, Python, SQL, and Excel. I bring a unique mix of analytical depth, cross-functional collaboration, and a love for problem-solving. After managing multi-million euro budgets and teaching complex maths, I am looking forward to transitioning into data science to turn messy, real-world data into clear, actionable insights. I'm also active in nonprofit leadership and public speaking, committed to using data—and storytelling—to make a difference. (June 2025 to Present)
