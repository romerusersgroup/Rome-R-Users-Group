Whether it’s a workshop, a meetup, or a project showcase, each event is an opportunity to share knowledge, build skills, and grow the R programming community in Rome and beyond.\nOur in-person focused group events are designed to foster deeper conversations and hands-on collaboration in smaller, interactive settings. Unlike large meetups, these sessions create space for participants to dive into specific topics, exchange ideas, and work through challenges side by side. By bringing people together in the same room, we create a supportive environment where learning feels personal, networking happens naturally, and everyone has a chance to contribute."

With 25 years in mathematics education and financial leadership, I’m completing a Master’s in Analysis & Modelling of Data & Processes as well as IBM’s Data Science Certificate, ready to pivot into Data Science. This has led me to work on hands-on projects using R, Python, SQL, and Excel. I bring a unique mix of analytical depth, cross-functional collaboration, and a love for problem-solving. After managing multi-million euro budgets and teaching complex maths, I am looking forward to transitioning into data science to turn messy, real-world data into clear, actionable insights. I’m also active in nonprofit leadership and public speaking, committed to using data—and storytelling—to make a difference. (June 2025 to Present)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLucy Michaels"
